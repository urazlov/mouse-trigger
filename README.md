# Mouse Trigger Utility

This is a simple Go utility that moves the mouse cursor left and right every seconds that you enter.

## Usage

2. Run the code:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

3. To build the binary:

    ```
    go build -o mouse-trigger main.go
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If the binary does not work as expected:

Check if the application has the required permissions in `System Preferences` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `Accessibility`.
